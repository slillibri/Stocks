This is a simple example project using Ruby with RabbitMQ and Cassandra.

stockpublisher.rb This script gathers stock information from Yahoo! and publishes them to different queues in RabbitMQ.

stockwatcher.rb This subscribes to the RabbitMQ queues and puts the data into the appropriate columns in Cassandra.

colstats.rb This just counts the column values for the current day.

stockgrapher.rb This is used to create graphs from the data stored in Cassandra.
